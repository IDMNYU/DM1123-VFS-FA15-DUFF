## END OF SEMESTER DROPBOX LINK or GOOGLE FOLDER REQUIREMENTS  

*Direct message the dropbox link or google drive folder link to deangela on slack.*

If you want to create a dropbox account and do not already have one, let me know. Both you and I can get additional free space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own **dropbox link**. A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual *dropbox folder*. Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) 
 
Create a dropbox link (NOT folder, see above) or google drive folder that contains the following: 

Folders (if you have additional drafts beyond these listed include those as well):

All assignments should be native illustrator files (.ai), photoshop files (.psd), and indesign files (.indd)

Make sure that any type in illustrator has been converted to outlines or include the typeface(s) in the folder(s) instead.

Make sure that images are included if they are not embedded within illustrator.
