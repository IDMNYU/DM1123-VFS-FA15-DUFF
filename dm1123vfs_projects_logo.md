# PROJECT: LOGO
###Create a logo for your selected brand in Adobe Illustrator.
* Select a brand that is personal to you in some way. 
* It could be your own, a friend’s, or a family member’s. 
* It could also be a redesign of an existing personal logo. If so, please post the original logo as well
* Throughout the semester, we’ll be investigating ways to visually communicate this brand, through creating an identity system which will consist of a logo, an interface, and a physical application.

##LOGO 1st Draft 
Explore creating <a href="http://www.logodesignsource.com/types.html" target="_blank">icons/symbols, logotypes, and/or combination logos</a>. Also, consider creating haptic / digital combos.

* Post to your tumblr or wordpress 
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description (1 to 2 sentences max) of your brand
* **At least 10 different versions of logo** iterations of your selected brand **ALL in grayscale (this includes black &amp; white)**
* One logo version per 8 1/2 x 11 (letter) dimensions
  * a big version (and a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner)
  * at least 3 should be digital
  * at least 3 should be haptic (non-digital) 
  * You will need to digitize haptic files (i.e. scan or take a digital photo, etc.)



## LOGO 2nd Draft 
Select at least 2 different versions, and create
**at least 5 different variations of each version** (for a total of at least 10 iterations in grayscale (black & white) or color based on each version selected in the previous class crit).
